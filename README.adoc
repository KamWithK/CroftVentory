= CroftVentory

A application to store and collect inventory information on devices being borrowed.
This uses Java, Gradle, OpenIJFX, and the H2 database.

To compile with IntelliJ IDEA, clone this repo and then open it.
On first time running with the IDE, ignore messages asking to locate JavaFX/OpenIJFX, or any other classes (these should disappear after the first run).
The needed external libraries should automatically be collected.
If this doesn't work try running the command: "./grandlew run" in the terminal.

Feel free to create an issue describing any problems/requests.
For issues, ensure to include a list of steps to reproduce the issue and any helpful/relevant logs/output!
